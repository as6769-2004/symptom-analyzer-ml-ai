# Symptom Analyzer using Machine Learning and Ollama AI

This project utilizes Ollama with the Mistral model, a local Large Language Model (LLM), to analyze user-provided symptoms and generate potential medical advice, including medicines, precautions, and general guidance. It also incorporates a machine learning model for disease prediction. **Please note that this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.**

## Features

* **Symptom Analysis:** Accepts user-provided symptoms as input via a Streamlit web interface.
* **Ollama AI Powered Insights (Mistral):** Leverages Ollama and the Mistral model to process symptoms and generate relevant medical information.
* **Machine Learning Assisted Disease Prediction:** Uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict potential diseases based on symptoms.
* **Medicine Suggestions (Informational Only):** Provides potential medicine names based on the analysis (for informational purposes only).
* **Precautionary Advice:** Offers general precautions related to the described symptoms.
* **General Medical Guidance:** Generates general advice related to the user's health concerns.
* **Streamlit Web Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use web interface for symptom analysis and chat interaction.
* **Session History:** Saves and loads analysis history, allowing users to review past sessions.
* **Chat Assistant:** Allows users to ask follow-up questions about their symptoms and analysis.

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.6+:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
* **Ollama:** Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/). You will also need to download the Mistral model: `ollama run mistral`
* **Required Python Packages:** Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/as6769-2004/symptom-analyzer-ml-ai](https://github.com/as6769-2004/symptom-analyzer-ml-ai)
    cd Symptoms_Analyzer/Symptom_analyzer
    ```

2.  **Install the Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Where `requirements.txt` contains:

    ```
    streamlit
    requests
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    ```

3.  **Ensure Ollama is running:** Start the Ollama service in your terminal.
    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```

4.  **Download the Mistral model:**
    ```bash
    ollama run mistral
    ```

5.  **Place Datasets:** Place `Training.csv` and `Testing.csv` inside a folder named `dataset` in the root of the project.

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Enter your symptoms:** Use the web interface to input your symptoms.

3.  **Receive the analysis:** The application will process your symptoms using Ollama and the machine learning model, then display the generated medical advice.

4.  **Use the Chat Assistant:** Ask follow-up questions related to the analysis in the chat interface.

5.  **Review History:** Use the sidebar to view previous analysis sessions.

## Example

* After running the Streamlit app, a web browser window will open.
* You will see input fields to enter your symptoms.
* After submitting the symptoms, the application will display the predicted disease and analysis results, including medicine suggestions, precautions, and advice.
* You can then use the chat interface to ask further questions.
* Previous sessions can be viewed from the side bar.
